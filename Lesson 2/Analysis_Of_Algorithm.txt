-->Analysis of algorithms
It is the most important step before we begin our data
structures and algorithms journey.

--->Why we need it???

As we know that there can be multiple solutions to a
problem by either using different programming techniques 
or by using different data structures.

So, how to decide which one is better, here analysis
of algorithm comes into play 


Example: We have to find sum of natural numbers

Soln 1:  /// simple Formula(Recursion)

int fun1(int n)
{
return n*(n-1);
}

Soln 2: /// Loop logic

int fun1(int n)
{
int c=0;
for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
{
  c=c+i;
}
return c;
}

Now all these give correct output.

Like here we got many solutions for a single problem 
And we have to select one of the best solution for the problem 


So we will find the time taken 
which may depend on many factors like machine,
programming language,system load


To find out which one is more efficient or ethically suitable to us 
we will be using asymptotic analysis.
